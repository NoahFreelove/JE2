<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The GLThread annotation is to be applied to methods which could be called or need to be called from the main OpenGL thread. This is often used with rendering operations. You can attempt to call these methods from secondary threads but you will get a crash. To call these methods you should use the Manager class to queue a GL method.
