  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The Data Loader class is a very important one and is responsible for all file loading.
    You can open files without using the data loader by using a filepath from your project's
    root and piping that path into a resource loader of some type.
    However, it is <strong>VERY EXTREMELY STRONGLY ENCOURAGED</strong> to use the data loader
    <strong>AND THE FOLLOWING FILE STRUCTURE</strong> for organizing your resources.
    <img class="example_image" src="../images/resource_file_layout_example.png" alt="How your resource folder should be structured"/>
    JE2 uses java's class loader and will pull files relative to that file structure.
    For example, to access <code>"src/main/resources/Your_Resources!"</code> you would call
    <code>get("Your_Resources!");</code> to get the absolute filepath from the resources folder.
  <br/><br/>
    <strong>
      HOWEVER I DON'T EVEN RECOMMEND USING THIS METHOD AS TEXTURES AND AUDIO LOADERS JUST REQUIRE
      A RELATIVE FILEPATH FROM YOUR "src/main/resources" FOLDER!
    </strong>
    <br/><br/>
    You really shouldn't have to worry about the DataLoader if you are only using the Texture and AudioSource
    classes for loading game assets. Just make sure when you pass in a filepath it is relative to
    <code>"src/main/resources/"</code> because that's what those loaders use! The loaders use this
    class loader method because it's the easiest way to access files when running from a jar archive.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <strong>NOTE: ONLY THE METHODS IN THIS CLASS THAT RETURN BYTE ARRAYS WILL WORK IN A JAR ARCHIVE.
    FILEPATHS DO NOT WORK BECAUSE OF THE JAR'S ZIP FORMAT!</strong>

      <p>
        path - relative path to resource from <code>"src/main/resources/"</code><br/>
        Will convert the relative resource path to an absolute file path.
        <br/>
        This will not work in a jar archive.
        <br/>
        This will return null if no file is found.

    <div class="methodBox"><h4><annotation>@JarSafe</annotation> <qualifiers>public static byte[]</qualifiers>
      <method>getDataFilePath</method>(<field>String path</field>)</h4>
      <p>
        path - relative path to resource from <code>"src/main/resources/"</code><br/>
        Will load the file into a byte array which can be used by various resource loaders.
        <br/>
        This will work in a jar file.
        <br/>
        This will return null if no file is found.
